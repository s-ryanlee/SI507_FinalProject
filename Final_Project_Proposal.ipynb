        "# 1. Project Overview\n",
        "## a. Project Outcome\n",
        "Front end: Users can generate and battle pokemon hybrids.  \n",
        "Back end: Pulls \"parent\" pokemon data from a PokeAPI constructed database to generate hybrid. \n",
        "\"Parent\" pokemon data is averaged to create hybrid pokemon's data. \n",
        "When hybrid pokemon \"battle\", a winner is predicted based on each pokemon's types, stats, moves, and abilities. \n",
        "## b. Project Outline\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Collect Data\n",
        "  - Use PokeAPI to collect data on all current pokemon names, descriptions, types, stats, abilities, moves, and habitats. \n",
        "  - Utilize webscraping of Bulbapedia to fill in missing data (such as type matchups).\n",
        "  - Implement caching for responsible aquisition. \n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Create Pokemon Datasets\n",
        "  - Construct various datasets consisting of \"parent\" pokemon, moves, abilities, and habitats.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Statistical Computations\n",
        "  - Determine type, move, and ability probabilities. \n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Generate Hybrids\n",
        "  - Develop hybrid generating function that:\n",
        "    - takes two pokemon, averages relavent data\n",
        "    - predicts type, moves, abilities, and habitats based on parent probabilities \n",
        "    - produces a \"child\" hybrid pokemon with attributes from both \"parent\" pokemon.\n",
        "    - Caches user generated hybrid pokemon for user to access at a later time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Battle Pokemon\n",
        "  - Determine pokemon for battle\n",
        "    - If pokemon exist in the database or cache \n",
        "      - pull pokemon data\n",
        "    - otherwise \n",
        "      - generate hybrid\n",
        "  - Predict winner based on stats, types, moves, and abilities \n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Create User Interfaces\n",
        "  - Create user interface that enables hybrid pokemon generation.\n",
        "  - Create user interface that enables battling two previously created hybrid pokemon, or a hybrid pokemon against an existing \"parent\" pokemon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Create front end presentation.\n",
        "  - Using Jupyter Notebook or Flask? \n",
        "\n",
        "## c. Project Inspiration\n",
        "\n",
        "Inspiration for this project comes from [Pokemon Fusion](https://pokemon.alexonsager.net/), a website that enables users to select two Generation I pokemon or randomly \"fuses\" two Generation I pokemon together.\n",
        "I wanted to build on this idea by incorporating pokemon from all generations and add functionality to enable users to \"battle\" their generated pokemon. "

        "> No authentication is required to access this API, and all resources are fully open and available. Since the move to static hosting in November 2018, rate limiting has been removed entirely, but we still encourage you to limit the frequency of requests to limit our hosting costs.\n",

If you would like to change this just add a 'limit' query parameter to the GET request, e.g. ?=60. You can use 'offset' to move to the next page, e.g. ?limit=60&offset=60.\n",
